1. What did we observe during the iteration? What was noteworthy?

There isn't a lot of time for complete thorough testing because tasks 
are completed last minute. Tasks can be much more difficult to actually 
implement than what was imagined during planning. Also, there were small 
understanding issues about how one wanted a task to be implemented.



2. What suggestions do we have for next time? How can we be a smarter,
happier, more productive team?

Complete your duties a bit earlier. Therefore, have a plan on what needs 
to be completed on specific days. Be more careful in merging to avoid 
merging conflicts. Speak up and ask for help if one doesn't understand 
how to implement their task.



3. What did we do well that we want to keep doing?

Starting the assignment early. Teammates are willing to help each other. 
Communicating to one another about what they are completing.
