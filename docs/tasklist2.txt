Scrum master: Jessica


Method to access objects anywhere: Prabhjot


1. Logging In and Logging Out: Jessica
--------------
- The user starts up the app and eventally reaches the list of events.
- From this screen, the user can choose to log in
- The user is enters his or her username and password to log in and retrieve
  a token number from the server.
- The user returns to the list of events. Now the user's name shows up on the
  screen to let them know that they are logged in.
- The user can choose to log out from this screen as well, at which point his
  or her name will disappear from the screen.

Variation 1:
 - If the user logged in during a previous session but did not log out, they
   are still logged in when the app starts.

Variation 2:
 - If the log in attempt is rejected by the server, the user is show a brief
   message and asked to try again. The user may cancel the log in process.

2. Sharing a Planned Event: Prabhjot
---------------------------
 - Assume that the user has created a new event and it shows up in the event
   list. Assume that the user is logged in.
 - The status of that event shows up as "unshared" in the list of events.
 - From the list of events, the user selects an unshared event and chooses
   to share it.
 - The app communicates with the central server to share the event, also
   receiving a unique ID for the event.
 - The event status is now listed as "shared" in the event list.

3. Sharing a Spontaneous Event: Prabhjot
-------------------------------
 - Assume that the user has created a new event and it shows up in the event
   list. The user need not be logged in.
 - The status of that event shows up as "unshared" in the list of events.
 - From the list of events, the user selects an unshared event and chooses
   to share it as a spontaneous event.
 - The app communicates with all other devices running the app nearby and
   broadcasts the event to them.
 - The event status is now listed as "spontaneous" in the event list.

4. Editing a Planned Event: Erick
---------------------------
 - Assume that the user has created and shared an event as in use case 2.
   The user is still logged into the app.
 - From the list of events, the user can select an event of their own
   and choose to edit it.
 - Editing the event, the user is able to change any of the event
   information from the original creation screen.
 - Instead of saving the event, the app submits the changed event to the
   central server.
 - Upon successfully submitting the event, the new local event details
   are also saved.

Variation 1:
 - If the user tries to edit an event that they did not create, the app
   will prevent them.

Variation 2:
 - The server may decline to update the event, leaving it unchanged.

5. Internationalization: Aaron
------------------------
 - Assume that the phone is presently configured to use English
 - The user uses the application normally and all text, labels, and
   so forth are displayed in English.
 - The user exits the app and runs the Custom Locale program to change the
   local of the emulated device (in an emulator).
 - The user launches the application again and sees all of the messages
   and text of the app itself displayed in the selected language.
